    Led development of a custom remote workflow management system for maintenance technicians and field staff. Additional capabilities were added to provide tools
    allowing front-office/administrative employees to oversee and dispatch scheduled jobs. Reporting utilities and email notification services were also implemented.

<p>Project is used by 200+ staff members, usually by tablet or mobile device.</p>
<h3>Tech</h3>
<p>
  Existing data and infrastructure lived in a legacy, vendor-provided system using ASP.NET Web Forms/MVC and SQL Server.
  Having done significant consulting work in the legacy system prior to this project, we understood that building a dynamic application 
  within the legacy infrastructure would be difficult and time consuming. The dashboard application was built using modern
  technologies, enabling rapid development while still making integration with the legacy system feasible.
